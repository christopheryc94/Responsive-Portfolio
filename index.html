				Hi! My name is Christopher Clark and I was born and raised in Tucson, Arizona. Though neither one of my parents are from Tucson, or Arizona for that matter, they met in Tucson in high school and started a family here. My mother is from a small town in Korea and my father is an Italian originally from New York, making me Korean and Italian; I know, an interesting mix. Growing up in Tucson I attended high school at Sahuaro where I was apart of the school orchestra for all four years and wrestling team for two before a shoulder injury put me out of my last season. Post high school I attended some classes at the University of Arizona but never really knew what I wanted to pursue for a career, which is why I am now currently taking a bootcamp for coding through the University.

				Other than a little history of myself, I enjoy: hiking, travelling, playing/listening to music, playing video games, reading, off-roading, shooting, playing sports, and the list will probably go on forever. I really enjoy most (if not all) things and doing anything and everything with good company.
